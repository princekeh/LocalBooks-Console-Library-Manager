# LocalBooks-Console-Library-Manager

📚 About the Project
This isn't some fancy web application—it's a straightforward, console-based library management system built entirely in Java. It’s perfect for demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like creating custom classes (Book) and managing dynamic collections using ArrayList. Think of it as the no-frills, reliable tool for a small office or personal collection.


✨ Key Features
 * Book Management: Easily add new books to the library's collection, specifying the title, author, and initial quantity.
 * Dynamic Storage: Uses Java's ArrayList to maintain a flexible and scalable list of books, rather than fixed arrays.
 * Borrow/Return Logic: Implements basic logic to decrement and increment book quantities when items are borrowed or returned.
 * Interactive Menu: A simple, clear menu system for users to navigate the system's functionalities.


🛠️ Getting Started
This project is pure Java, so setup is blissfully simple.



💡 Prerequisites

You only need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.



💡 How It Works (Code Insight)
The real magic is in the Book class, which keeps the data (title, author, quantity) logically grouped and separated from the main application logic. The LibrarySystem class then holds an ArrayList<Book> to manage all the available titles. This separation of concerns makes the code clean and much easier to maintain.
